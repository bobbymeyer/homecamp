<h1 class='text-2xl '>About Our Home Summer Camp</h1>
Welcome to our adventure-packed, family-driven Home Summer Camp! We're a family with two young kids, and like many parents, we found that traditional summer camps can be expensive and logistically challenging. So, we're rolling up our sleeves to create our own enriching summer experience.

<h1 class='text-2xl '>Our Plan</h1>
Each week is filled with daily activities centered around exciting themes that will spark curiosity, creativity, and a love for learning. In addition to these daily plans, we've set up a semi-permanent camp in our backyard, creating a space for exploration, play, and imagination to run wild.

We'll also be learning about a different constellation each week. With the clear California skies, our backyard serves as the perfect observatory, giving our kids a chance to connect with the stars and expand their celestial knowledge.

<h1 class='text-2xl '>Making It Your Own</h1>
We're located in Ventura County, and our planned field trips might not be available or accessible where you are. But that's no problem! Find similar activities or attractions near you to bring a fresh twist to your camp schedule. 

Also, while we'll be exploring constellations visible from our backyard, some may not be seen in your region or on your specific dates. You can always look up the night sky visible in your area and identify different stars or constellations to inspire your kids.

We're simply sharing what we're doing, hoping it helps inspire others to plan creative adventures with their kids. We're not running a camp or any kind of business, just sharing our journey!
